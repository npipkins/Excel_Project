# Excel Project

## Background

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

## Analytical Work

Using the data provided, I modified and analyzied the data of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects while I attempted to uncover some market trends.

The following excel actions were used: conditional formatting, formulas, text to columns, pivot tables, charts & graphs, timestamps, statistical problem solving, etc.
